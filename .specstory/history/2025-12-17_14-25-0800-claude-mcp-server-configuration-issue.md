The user is getting an error about MCP server configuration in Claude Code. The error message says that on Windows, it requires a 'cmd /c' wrapper to execute npx for the tailwindcss-mcp-server.

Let me read the `.claude.json` file to see the current configuration and fix it.</details></think>

I can see the issue. Looking at the config file, specifically the project entry for `C:/Users/ramis/OneDrive/Desktop/Programming/my-website/my-website` (lines 302-333), the MCP server configuration is incorrect:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "tailwindcss-mcp-server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "/c",
      "npx",
      "-y",
      "tailwindcss-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

The issue is that on Windows, you need to use `cmd` as the command with `/c` as the first argument to run `npx`. Currently it's using `npx` as the command with `/c` as an argument, which is incorrect.

The correct configuration should be:
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "tailwindcss-mcp-server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "cmd",
    "args": [
      "/c",
      "npx",
      "-y",
      "tailwindcss-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

Let me fix this in the file.</details></think>

I found the issue! The MCP server configuration for `tailwindcss-mcp-server` is using `npx` as the command with `/c` as an argument, but on Windows, you need to use `cmd` as the command with `/c` as the first argument to execute `npx`.

Current (incorrect):
```json
"command": "npx",
"args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "tailwindcss-mcp-server"]
```

Should be:
```json
"command": "cmd",
"args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "tailwindcss-mcp-server"]
```

Let me fix this:

The fix has been applied. The MCP server configuration now correctly uses `cmd` as the command with `/c` as the first argument, which is the proper way to execute `npx` on Windows.</details></think>

Done! The fix has been applied. The change was:

- **Before**: `"command": "npx"` (incorrect for Windows)
- **After**: `"command": "cmd"` (correct - wraps npx with `cmd /c`)

On Windows, `npx` needs to be executed through the command prompt wrapper (`cmd /c npx ...`) because Windows doesn't natively understand how to execute npm scripts directly in the same way Unix shells do.

You'll need to restart Claude Code for the MCP server configuration changes to take effect. The warning should be gone after that!
